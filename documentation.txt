What your site does and what its purpose:
- I made a basic twitter, called yeller, because every tweet is auto-caps.
- Ironically, the live updates make it double as a chat client in the global feed.


How you used MVC and which framework you used:
- My models describe the database contents (accounts and yells).
- My controllers provide access to the models and return processed data, as well as the single handlebars page.
- My views are React components on a single page site. All rooted in a single <div id="page"></div>.
- Express was used.


What you used Mongo for (what did you store/retrieve):
- Account Model:
  - username (string)
  - follows (array of objectIDs of Account)
  - salt, password, createdDate
- Account Controller:
  - login
  - logout
  - signup
  - follow N users (if logged in)
  - unfollow N users (if logged in)
  - getStatus of a session for resuming the single page site
  - getRelation of N users against the same N users (currently just if users are following each other)
  - applySettings of varying types, completeness not required, multiple settings supported at once (if logged in)
  - getFollows of N users, providing the follow list of each user as an array of names

- Yell Model:
  - message (string)
  - owner (objectID of Account)
  - createdDate
- Yell Controller:
  - getYells of a single user, or the 10 most recent yells, or all the yells of people the currently logged in person follows
  - makeYell makes a yell


How you used a templating language and which templating language you used:
- I called .render(...) on a single .handlebars file. Yep. See notes please, I made a single page site.


How did you go above and beyond?:
1) single page website
2) extensive error checking with feedback
3) database populating for id referencing
4) database array accesses for in, out, and update operations
5) user profiles via /:username route
6) extensive React usage
7) spent at least 20 hours debugging extensive mongoose bugs, like actual bugs in mongoose
8) probably broke a record with pestering Cody


Notes for grader:
1) Cody gave me permission to count the password change popup as an additional view, since it contains a second item and is a popup.
2) Cody gave me permission to not use handlebars templating. I call res.render('/app') only.
